### Hello, friend ğŸ‘‹

I see you are checking my GitHub! Welcome! My name is Helen and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at U of T. I am currently working on ğŸŒ± several projects in computational biology ğŸ§¬ ğŸ§¬ ğŸ§¬  - mostly centered around next-generation sequencing data. Some projects are still under wraps ğŸŒ¯ but I will strive to keep this updated!

In the meantime, if you want to learn more about me, check out [my website](https://helen-zhu.github.io/) and feel free to get in touch!
